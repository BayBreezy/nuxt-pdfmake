# UI Doc Starter

We all know how annoying it is to setup a new documentation project. That is why this was created to help you get started quickly with [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) & [UI Thing](https://ui-thing.behonbaker.com/getting-started/introduction). UI Thing is just a set of Nuxt components that were styled to look like the ones from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Modules

There are several modules at play in this project:

- [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/)
- [Nuxt TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/)
- [Nuxt Color Mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/)
- [Nuxt Icons](https://github.com/nuxt/icon)
- [Nuxt Image](https://image.nuxt.com/)
- [V-Wave](https://github.com/justintaddei/v-wave?tab=readme-ov-file#nuxt-)
- [Nuxt ESLint](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module)
- [Nuxt PWA](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/frameworks/nuxt.html#nuxt-3)
