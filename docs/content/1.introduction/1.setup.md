description: Add pdfMake to your Nuxt project easily with this module.

## Installation

1. Add `nuxt-pdfmake` dependency to your project

```bash [NPM]
npm install -D nuxt-pdfmake
```

1. Add `nuxt-pdfmake` to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.js`

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["nuxt-pdfmake"],
});
```

3. Extract the `$pdfMake` instance from the `useNuxtApp` composable & use it in your functions!

## Usage

There are two ways in which you can use the `pdfMake` instance in your Nuxt project:

1. **Plugin usage** - You can destructure the `$pdfMake` instance from the `useNuxtApp` composable and use it in your functions.

```ts {} [plugins/pdfMake.ts]
const exportData = () => {
  const { $pdfMake } = useNuxtApp();
  const docDefinition = {
    content: [
      "First paragraph",
      "Another paragraph, this time a little bit longer to make sure, this line will be divided into at least two lines",
    ],
  };
  $pdfMake.createPdf(docDefinition).open();
};
```

2. **Composable usage** - You may use the auto-imported `usePDFMake` composable to access the `$pdfMake` instance.

```ts {} [pages/index.vue]
const exportData = () => {
  usePDFMake()
    .createPdf({
      content: [
        "First paragraph",
        "Another paragraph, this time a little bit longer to make sure, this line will be divided into at least two lines",
      ],
    })
    .open();
};
```
